About My Project Portfolio

This website is a collection of my software projects created during my BCA studies and personal learning journey. It includes Android apps (like MedicoMart), Windows desktop applications, Flask-based web tools, and SQL Server data solutions. Each project reflects my skills in frontend/backend development, problem-solving, and real-world application building.
